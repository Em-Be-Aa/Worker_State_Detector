# Worker State Detection Program

This program analyzes videos or live camera footage to monitor a worker's state and provide insights into their activity levels.

Key Features:

1. Visualizing worker movements: Overlays a skeleton on the video to track the worker's body posture and movements.
2. Detecting working and idle states: Identifies whether the worker is actively working or idle based on their arm angle.
3. Measuring efficiency: Calculates the percentage of time spent working.
4. Displaying key metrics: Shows FPS, working time, idle time, number of cycles completed, arm angle, and efficiency in real-time.
5. Customizable information display: Allows toggling the visibility of different metrics.
6. Video source selection: Supports switching between multiple videos or using a live camera feed.

Usage:

1. Run the program: Execute the Python script.
2. Choose a video source: Use the dropdown menu to select a video or camera.
3. Toggle information display: Click the buttons to show or hide specific metrics.
4. Observe worker activity: The program will display the video with overlays and metrics.

Potential Applications:

1. Monitoring worker productivity: Assess individual and team performance.
2. Identifying inefficiencies: Analyze patterns of idle time and potential bottlenecks.
3. Evaluating ergonomic risks: Assess worker posture and movements for potential strain or injury.
4. Enhancing safety: Detect unsafe behaviors or potential hazards.

   
Note: This program is designed for educational and experimental purposes. It may not be suitable for professional use without further validation and testing. Thanks
